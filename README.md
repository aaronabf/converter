Converter
=========

After being fed-up with daily google searches to suboptimal bin/decimal/hex converters, I wrote this for personal use. I think I managed to iron out all the bugs, let me know if you encounter any.

Also, I was a tad lazy and so you can only convert a negative decimal for signed converion. Hopefully, I'll have time to build out the rest of the signed conversion.
